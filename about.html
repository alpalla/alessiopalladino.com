            </h1><p>Hi there I’m Alessio and welcome to my blog! I’m currently working as a full-stack developer (doing some DevOps stuff too) and this blog is <strong>where I write about what I learn to learn it better</strong>. I also occasionally write about stuff that has nothing to do with software or computers.</p>
<h1 class="post-body-header">
              <a name="why-this-blog" href="#why-this-blog">Why this blog</a>
            </h1><p>Have you ever found yourself listening to other developers mention a term you might understand but wouldn’t really be able to explain if you were asked to define it? Or have you ever heard a term you don’t know at all? What about all the information you stumble upon on the internet when all you’re trying to do is horizontally center a <code class="inline-code" data-themeable>div</code>?</p>
<p>Well all of the above happens to me, and it happens often enough that I decided to blog about it.</p>
<p>Software development and computer science in general are incredibly interesting but it’s such a big world that a developer can’t realistically be expected to know <em>EVERYTHING</em>.</p>
<p>The goal for me here is, <em>when confronted with something new I’m learning</em>, to write about it well enough so that someone else could learn from the resulting blog post. At least if I forget something I learned 6 months ago, I’d like to be able to more quickly brush up on the topic by just reading what I wrote about it earlier.</p>
<p>I wrote my own static website generator (for fun) to create this blog, I hope you enjoy!</p>
